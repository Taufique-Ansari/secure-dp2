Shopping Website with Differential Privacy
This project is a fully functional e-commerce website similar to Amazon or Flipkart, with a primary focus on data privacy through differential privacy. The website allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, and make purchases through a secure payment gateway. The project utilizes a robust tech stack to ensure scalability, security, and responsiveness.

Project Overview
The project aims to build a shopping website where users can:

Browse a catalog of products
Add items to a cart
Complete the checkout process with secure payment options
Differential privacy is applied to protect users' sensitive information. This project is designed to simulate a real-world e-commerce application with a focus on privacy and security.

Tech Stack
Frontend
React for component-based user interfaces
Redux for state management
Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive design
Backend
Node.js with Express for handling server-side logic
Differential Privacy Library (like Google's DP library) for implementing data privacy protocols
Authentication using JWT for secure user sessions
Database
MongoDB for storing product data, user information, and orders
Redis (optional) for session management and caching
Features
Product Listing - Users can view products across various categories with filters.
Product Details - Detailed product pages with images, reviews, and specifications.
Shopping Cart - Ability to add, remove, and update quantities of products in the cart.
Checkout - Secure checkout process with payment integration.
Order History - Users can view past orders and statuses.
Differential Privacy - Privacy measures for handling sensitive user data during transactions and product interactions.
Differential Privacy
Differential privacy ensures user data is anonymized, adding a layer of protection against data re-identification. This includes:

Noise Addition: Random noise is added to datasets to mask real user data.
Data Aggregation: Only aggregated and anonymized data is accessible for analytics.
Privacy Budget: Controls the extent of privacy to prevent excessive data leakage.
Libraries like Google's Differential Privacy library or similar tools can be integrated to add these protections.

Frontend
The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for all site functionalities, including:

Home Page - Featured products and categories
Search and Filtering - Search bar, categories, and product filters
Product Pages - Detailed pages with product descriptions, reviews, and ratings
Shopping Cart - A dynamic cart that updates as users add or remove items
Checkout and Payment - Secure checkout with payment options
Technologies:

React for building components
Redux for managing cart and user data across components
CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap/Tailwind) for consistent styling
Backend
The backend is responsible for managing data flow, security, and privacy.

Express.js handles routes and server-side logic
JWT Authentication for secure access to user-specific pages and actions
API for product listings, cart actions, and checkout process
Differential Privacy Implementation within analytics and user data handling
Key Endpoints
/api/products - Fetch product listings
/api/product/
- Fetch product details
/api/cart - Add/remove products from cart
/api/checkout - Process orders and handle payments
/api/orders - Fetch user order history
Database
MongoDB serves as the primary database:

Products Collection: Stores product details
Users Collection: Stores user information and preferences
Orders Collection: Stores order history and transaction details
Differential privacy is applied to any user analytics or aggregated data extracted from the database.
